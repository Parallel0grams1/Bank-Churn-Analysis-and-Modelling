# Churn Analysis and Modelling using Machine Learning and Neural Network

This project uses various Machine Learning Models(MLM) and Artificial Neural Network(ANN) to predict potential customer churn in a banking institution.
Churn analysis in banking is the analysing of behaviour or patterns that result in customer attrition. By identifying factors, banks can take proactive measures to reduce attrition and improve customer retention.

There are 7 ML models used in this project. They are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Adaboost, XGBoost, Light Gradient Boosting and Catboost. Those models will be compared with each other to determine which one are more effective in determining Churn.
Similarly, 2 ANN models that will be used. The Keras ANN and a variation of Keras ANN with K-fold cross validation will be compared together. To conclude, feature importance is used to determine the coefficients and key features that play a huge role in influencing churn.

There will be 3 different notebook in this repository. The first notebook will be the initial Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), and it covers data preprocessing and data visualization. The second notebook will be the churn modelling using MLM and the last notebook will be the modelling using ANN and feature importance.
